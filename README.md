# SharpC8
A rewrite of my [Python Chip-8 Emulator](https://github.com/probablyquill/PythonC8) using C# and monogame.

Requires dotnet version 6.0 and Monogame.

If this is a project you would like to undertake for yourself, I primarily used these resources for the original Python version:

[Chip-8 - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8)

[Cowgod's Chip-8 Technical Reference](http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM)

[Timendus' Chip-8 Test Suite](https://github.com/Timendus/chip8-test-suite)

[How to write an emulator (CHIP-8 interpreter) by Laurence Muller](https://multigesture.net/articles/how-to-write-an-emulator-chip-8-interpreter/)


## Requirements:
Install [Monogame](https://monogame.net/articles/getting_started/index.html)

## Launch:
Currently there are no releases due to missing features. You can compile the application using the included Visual Studio project.

## Licence
All code is provided as-is and is licensed under the [MIT](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) license.
